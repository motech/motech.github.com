					<h4>Description</h4>
					
					Developer Release 1 of the MOTECH platform is meant as an early technology release focused on developers.  At this point in time the system is functional, but we haven't spent much time yet on documentation or user interface so the use of the system for non-developers is limited.
					
					<h4>Release Notes</h4>
					
					<h4>Build Instructions</h4>
					
					You can build the platform by checking out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/motech/source/list?name=DR1">DR1</a> tag and running <pre>mvn install</pre>
					
					You can include any platform module in your mvn build by placing the following in your pom:
					
					{% highlight xml %}
				    <repositories>
				        <repository>
				            <id>motech-repo</id>
				            <name>Motech Maven Repository</name>
				            <url>http://nexus.motechproject.org/content/repositories/public</url>
				        </repository>
				    </repositories>
				
					<dependency>
					  <groupId>org.motechproject</groupId>
					  <artifactId>[module name]</artifactId>
					  <version>DR1</version>
					</dependency>
					{% endhighlight %}
					
					<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>
					
					We will be releasing a puppet script that can be run on Ubunutu to install and start pre-requisite services.  The script will also pull down the DR1 release and install it in a tomcat container.  If you want to manually install Motech you will need:
					
					<ul>
						<li>Tomcat</li>
						<li>MySQL</li>
						<li>CouchDB</li>
						<li>java</li>
						<li>ActiveMQ</li>
					</ul>
