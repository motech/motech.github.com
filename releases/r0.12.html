          <h4>Description</h4>
          
          Release 0.12 of the MOTECH platform is meant as an early technology release focused on developers. At this point in time the system is functional, but we have not spent much time yet on documentation or user interface so the use of the system for non-developers is limited.
          
          <h4>Release Notes</h4>
          Please refer to the following <a href="http://code.google.com/p/motech/wiki/ReleaseZeroPointTwelve">link</a> for the release notes for this release.
          
          <h4>Build Instructions</h4>
          
          You can build the platform by checking out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/motech/source/list?name=motech-0.12">motech-0.12</a> tag and running <pre>mvn install</pre>
          
          You can include any platform module in your mvn build by placing the following in your pom:
