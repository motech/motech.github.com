<h3>Adherence</h3>

<p>One of the major benefits of the MOTECH SUITE is the ability to close the loop between advising action and verifying that action was taken. This can take several forms, inlcuding monitoring adherence to prescription regimens for TB or anti-retroviral treatment and ensuring referrals are acted upon.</p>

<h4>Why Adherence is Important</h4>

<p>Information alone can be effective at increasing health-seeking behaviors, but ensuring better health outcomes requires verification that the behaviors are followed and intervention if they are not. The current systems in most of the regions targeted by MOTECH SUITE use paper-based recordkeeping. Once data goes is recorded in these systems, it typically is not reviewed until the patient returns. With a mobile-enabled system based on MOTECH SUITE, medical records can actively trigger reminders or follow-up steps when recommended behaviors have not been acted upon.

<h4>Key MOTECH SUITE Adherence Capabilities</h4>

<ul>
	<li>* Patient-reported pill aherence via SMS or IVR.</li>
	<li>* FLW-facilitated adherence (e.g., DOTS) reporting.</li>
	<li>* Verification that referrals for lab tests or other services are acted upon.</li>
	<li>* Reporting of lab results back to the initiating FLW and/or patient.</li>
	<li>* Flexible message format: Messages available to low-literacy clients via IVR, higher literacy populations as SMS or even email.</li>
	<li>* Works with field-appropriate technology:  SMS and IVR messages are available on the low-end phones typically found in the populations we serve.</li>
</ul>
