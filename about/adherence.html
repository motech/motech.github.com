<h3>Demand Generation</h3>

<p>MOTECH SUITE applications can drive demand for health services and health-seeking behaviors through direct messages to clients. These messages can be delivered via IVR or SMS to reach a broad client base regardless of literacy.</p>

<h4>Why Demand Generation is Important</h4>

<p>Messaging directly to patients allows the MOTECH SUITE application to drive client behavior change including increased adherence to appointment and vaccination schedules. The appeal of mobile technology increases the perceived authority of the messages and makes it more likely that messages are shared within a clientâ€™s sphere of influence (e.g., spouse or mother-in-law).

<h4>Key MOTECH SUITE Demand Generation Capabilities</h4>

<ul>
	<li>* Flexible message format: Messages available to low-literacy clients via IVR, higher literacy populations as SMS or even email.</li>
	<li>* Works with field-appropriate technology:  SMS and IVR messages are available on the low-end phones typically found in the populations we serve.</li>
	<li>* Supports individual owner and shared phone scenarios: In many areas, multiple clients may share a phone. Optional authentication allows multiple users to access messages from a single phone.</li>
	<li>* Personalized messages: Messages and message schedules can be tailored to individual client medical or demographic information (e.g., messages for clients in their 26th week of pregnancy).</li>
