<h3>MOTECH Platform Roadmap</h3>

<p>Starting with the "Salk" release in the Fall of 2012, MOTECH Platform will move to a cadence of monthly releases, with stable releases happening quarterly. The lists below mention some of the major features that we expect to implement in each coming release.</p>
<p>Our releases are named after physicians who have made major contributions to the advancement of medicine. Because current implementations of MOTECH are focused on maternal/child health, HIV/AIDS, and TB, and because we currently work in India and Africa, we may exhibit particular bias towards physicians who have worked in these areas when choosing namesakes for our releases.</p>
<h4>Q3 2012 ("Salk")</h4>
