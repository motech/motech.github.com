<h3>MOTECH System Overview</h3>

<p>The Mobile Technology for Community Health (MOTECH) Platform is an open source software project delivered by Grameen Foundation through funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. It enables organizations building mHealth solutions to develop, manage, and monitor those solutions more quickly and cost-effectively with fewer technical resources. It also allows multiple mHealth solutions serving the same population to be deployed in a way that enables data sharing (where appropriate) and a better experience for users of the system.</p>

<h4>What can the MOTECH Platform do?</h4>

<p>The MOTECH Platform is best-suited for mHealth applications which improve health by sending messages to patients and caregivers based on an evaluation of the recommended schedule of care compared to the patient’s health-related actions. Some features of typical MOTECH-based applications are:</p>

<p>Communicate information to patients via voice or SMS according to a schedule of care defined for the patient’s condition, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
	<li>* Reminders for ANC appointments, lab visits, etc.</li>
	<li>* Reminders to take medication on schedule e.g. DOTS, ART, etc.</li>
	<li>* Reminder notices to take children for scheduled immunization services</li>
</ul>
<p>Collect data from patients or caregivers, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
	<li>* Patients report their symptoms prior to treatment or during  treatment (adverse events)</li>
	<li>* Patients give feedback on service delivery</li>
	<li>* Caregivers report what service was delivered to a patient and on what date</li>
</ul>
<p>Alert caregivers of the status of their patients, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
	<li>* Notify Community Health Worker when patient has not taken ART, DOTs or other drugs</li>
	<li>* Notify nurse when patient has not kept a scheduled appointment (e.g. ANC visit)</li>
	<li>* Alert</li>
</ul>
<p>Facilitate communication between patients, caregivers, and/or health administrators, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
	<li>* Establish secure peer networks for patients who share similar health concerns</li>
	<li>* Initiate conversations between patients and caregivers in a way that allows the caregiver to manage the workload effectively</li></ul></li>
</ul>
