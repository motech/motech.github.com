<h3>MOTECH System Overview</h3>

<p>The Mobile Technology for Community Health (MOTECH) Platform is an open source software project delivered by Grameen Foundation through funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. It enables organizations building mHealth solutions to develop, manage, and monitor those solutions more quickly and cost-effectively with fewer technical resources. It also allows multiple mHealth solutions serving the same population to be deployed in a way that enables data sharing (</p>where appropriate) and a better experience for users of the system.

<h4>What is the MOTECH Platform for?</h4>

<p>The MOTECH Platform is best-suited for mHealth applications which improve health by sending messages to patients and caregivers based on an evaluation of the recommended schedule of care compared to the patient’s health-related actions. Some features of typical MOTECH-based applications are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Communicate information to patients via voice or SMS according to a schedule of care defined for the patient’s condition, e.g.:
<ul>
	<li>Reminders for ANC appointments, lab visits, etc.</li>
	<li>Reminders to take medication on schedule e.g. DOTS, ART, etc.</li>
	<li>Reminder notices to take children for scheduled immunization services</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Collect data from patients or caregivers, e.g.:
<ul><li>Patients report their symptoms prior to treatment or during  treatment (adverse events)</li>
<li>Patients give feedback on service delivery</li>
<li>Caregivers report what service was delivered to a patient and on what date</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Alert caregivers of the status of their patients, e.g.:
<ul><li>Notify Community Health Worker when patient has not taken ART, DOTs or other drugs</li>
<li>Notify nurse when patient has not kept a scheduled appointment (e.g. ANC visit)</li>
<li>Alert</li></ul></li>
<li>Facilitate communication between patients, caregivers, and/or health administrators, e.g.:
<ul><li>Establish secure peer networks for patients who share similar health concerns</li>
<li>Initiate conversations between patients and caregivers in a way that allows the caregiver to manage the workload effectively</li></ul></li>
</ul>
