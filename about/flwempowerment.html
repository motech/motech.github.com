<h3>Healthcare Worker Empowerment</h3>

<p>A MOTECH SUITE application can be used to train Front Line Workers (FLWs), help them manage their workload and facilitate more productive interactions with their patients.</p>

<h4>Why Healthcare Worker Empowerment is Important</h4>

<p>Interactions between FLWs and their clients are key drivers of client health outcomes. When FLWs are better trained and have better resources available to help guide them during their client interactions, they are more effective. This is because they have more better information to share with their patients, perform the recommended protocols more accurately, and more accurately collect the data needed to monitor outcomes.
