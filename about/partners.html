<div class="column-container clearfix">

<p>The MOTECH Suite has been created by a consortium of partners who recognize their complementary software efforts can address core needs of mHealth.</p>
<h3>Development partners</h3>
<h4><img src="/assets/logos/dimagi.png" alt="Dimagi"/> </h4>

<p><a href="http://www.dimagi.com/">Dimagi</a> produces <a href="http://www.commcarehq.org/home/">CommCare</a>, a mobile phone-based job aid for community health workers which facilitates better interaction between health care workers and patients. The CommCare UI is a series of forms that walk the caregiver and patient through the information and questions to be covered for a specific appointment protocol. In addition to presenting information, CommCare can be used to input data about the patient’s visit. CommCare runs on medium-low capability phones and higher end phones.</p>

<p>CommCareHQ is the server component which stores the data collected by the CommCare handset application. CommCareHQ communicates with MOTECH server to coordinate care between the two systems.</p> 

<p>CommCare and MOTECH perform complementary roles with CommCare facilitating interactions between CHW and client as well as CHW workforce management while MOTECH is responsible for messaging to clients and caregivers as well as connections to external healthcare systems. CommCare and MOTECH are currently partnering on work with CARE in Bihar.</p>

<h4><img src="/assets/logos/usm.gif" alt="University of Southern Maine"/> </h4>

<p>The <a href="http://usm.maine.edu/">University of Southern Maine</a> Computer Science Department has been involved in MoTeCH platform design and development since its inception in Ghana. Working with Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, Ghana Health Service, and Grameen, the USM team 
helped define a software architecture to deliver timely health information to pregnant women, new mothers, and nurses with mobile technology. USM continues its collaboration with the Grameen Foundation to help define and develop a new, robust, MoTeCH platform that meets the needs of larger populations, applies to a broader range of health domains, and is significantly easier to deploy in low-resource settings.

<h4><img src="/assets/logos/tw.jpg" alt="ThoughtWorks" /></h4>

<p><a href="http://thoughtworks.com/">Thoughtworks</a> has been a key implementing partner on most of the MOTECH applications built to date, including MOTECH Ghana, TAMA, and Ananya. They are also significant contributors to the overall MOTECH platform. </p>

<h4><img src="/assets/logos/instedd.gif" alt="InSTEDD" /></h4>

<p><a href="http://instedd.com/">InSTEDD</a> has several technologies which insulate application developers from the complexity of dealing with individual operator/aggregator IVR or SMS systems. Grameen is partnering with InSTEDD to connect their <a href="http://instedd.org/technologies/nuntium/">Nuntium</a> and <a href="http://instedd.org/technologies/verboice/">Verboice</a> technogies to expand the reach of the SMS and IVR capabilities of MOTECH applications.</p>

<p><a href="http://villagereach.org/">Village Reach</a> improves access to healthcare for remote, underserved communities around the world. Through their OpenLMIS project, they are building a scalable and sustainable logistics solution for healtcare.</p>

<h3>Implementation Partners</h3>
<h4><img src="/assets/logos/care.gif" alt="CARE"/></h4>
<p>CARE is an international development organization. CARE has been working in India for over 60 years, focusing on ending poverty through improvement in the lives and livelihoods of women from poor and marginalised communities through well-planned and comprehensive programmes in health, education, livelihoods and disaster response. CARE is a major participant in the Ananya effort in Bihar, India. Since January 2011, CARE along with consortium partners (AMDD - Columbia University; Abt Associates; Emory University; Janani and Save the Children) is implementing Integrated Family Health Initiative (IFHI) in eight districts of Bihar with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and to be scaled-up to all 38 districts of Bihar in the third year of the project. The overall goal of CARE-IFHI is to support Government of Bihar (GoB) in achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 4 and 5 over 2011-15 by increasing consistent availability of high impact, cost-effective and high quality family health interventions in the areas of maternal health, family planning, neonatal and child health, immunization and nutrition through two large public sector programs such as National rural health mission (NRHM) of the health department and Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) of Women and Child Development (WCD) department. Interventions in these technical areas are being planned through specific solution levers, which will work on specific critical barriers to bring desired changes. In addition the project has shortlisted select technical and cross cutting innovations that have potential to be game changers (in terms of impact) to be pilot tested in Bihar. These innovations will be rigorously evaluated for its impact and feasibility of scale-up. In one of the innovations, CARE is testing extensive use of handset application by front-line health workers for improving frequency and timeliness of home visits and quality of counselling during home visits through a Randomized Control Trial. MOTECH Suite is being used in this innovation.</p>
<h4><img src="/assets/logos/bbc.jpg" alt="BBC World Service Trust"/></h4>
<p>The BBC World Service Trust is also a major participant in the Ananya effort in Bihar, India. BBCWST is creating job aids and training materials which will be distributed to front line health workers via MOTECH.</p>
<h4><img src="/assets/logos/whp.gif" alt="World Health Partners"/></h4>
<p>World Health Partners (WHP) is an international nonprofit organization that provides health and reproductive health services to rural and other vulnerable communities in low-income countries by harnessing local market forces to work for the poor. Leveraging existing social and economic infrastructure, they utilize the latest advances in communication, diagnostic and medical technology to establish large scale, cost-effective health service networks.  Under the Ananya partnership, WHP is running a large scale social franchise network of private rural telemedicine centers, urban health clinics and labs in Bihar, India.  WHP will be using MOTECH to increase the range of services their rural franchisees can perform, and improve communications and reach to beneficiaries, starting with reporting and adherence tracking of tuberculosis patients.</p>
<h4><img src="/assets/logos/jandj.gif" alt="Johnson & Johnson"/></h4>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson is deploying the Treatment and Mobile Alerts program in urban India. This project aims to increase the appointment and treatment adherence for patients on anti-retroviral regimens. </p>
<h4><img src="/assets/logos/worldvision.jpg" alt="World Vision"/></h4>
<p>World Vision Zambia is using MOTECH Suite to improve their ability to deliver maternal and HIV/AIDs referrals and care in their OVC/STEPS program. World vision is committed to partnering with the people of Zambia to improve their lives today and to help enact sustainable solutions for the future of their children, families, and communities.</p>
<h4><img src="/assets/logos/grameen.png" alt="Grameen Foundation"/></h4>
<p>Grameen Foundation has deployed MOTECH in the Upper East Region of Ghana. This project launched in July, 2010 and is now being scaled up nationally.</p>
