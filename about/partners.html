title: MOTECH - Mobile Technology for Community Health
---

<div class="column-container clearfix">

<p>MOTECH addresses the challenge of evalutating a patient's history, comparing it to a prescribed schedule of care, and initiating messages between patients, caregivers, administrators, and external healthcare systems. Working with our partners, we expand the effectiveness of solutions built on MOTECH.</p>
<h3>Development partners</h3>
<h4><img src="/assets/logos/dimagi.png" alt="Dimagi"/> </h4>

<p><a href="http://www.dimagi.com/">Dimagi</a> produces <a href="http://www.commcarehq.org/home/">CommCare</a>, a mobile phone-based job aid for community health workers which facilitates better interaction between health care workers and patients. The CommCare UI is a series of forms that walk the caregiver and patient through the information and questions to be covered for a specific appointment protocol. In addition to presenting information, CommCare can be used to input data about the patient’s visit. CommCare runs on medium-low capability phones and higher end phones.</p>

<p>CommCareHQ is the server component which stores the data collected by the CommCare handset application. CommCareHQ communicates with MOTECH server to coordinate care between the two systems.</p> 

<p>CommCare and MOTECH perform complementary roles with CommCare facilitating interactions between CHW and client as well as CHW workforce management while MOTECH is responsible for messaging to clients and caregivers as well as connections to external healthcare systems. CommCare and MOTECH are currently partnering on work with CARE in Bihar.</p>

<h4><img src="/assets/logos/usm.gif" alt="University of Southern Maine"/> </h4>

<p>The <a href="http://usm.maine.edu/">University of Southern Maine</a> Computer Science Department has been involved in MoTeCH platform design and development since its inception in Ghana. Working with Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, Ghana Health Service, and Grameen, the USM team 
helped define a software architecture to deliver timely health information to pregnant women, new mothers, and nurses with mobile technology. USM continues its collaboration with the Grameen Foundation to help define and develop a new, robust, MoTeCH platform that meets the needs of larger populations, applies to a broader range of health domains, and is significantly easier to deploy in low-resource settings.

<h4><img src="/assets/logos/tw.jpg" alt="ThoughtWorks" /></h4>

<p><a href="http://thoughtworks.com/">Thoughtworks</a> has been a key implementing partner on most of the MOTECH appications built to date, including MOTECH Ghana, TAMA, and Ananya. They are also significant contributors to the overall MOTECH platform.</p>

<h4><img src="/assets/logos/instedd.gif" alt="InSTEDD" /></h4>

<p><a href="http://instedd.com/">InSTEDD</a> has several technogies which insulate application developers from the complexity of dealing with individual operator/aggregator IVR or SMS systems. Grameen is partnering with InSTEDD to connect their <a href="http://instedd.org/technologies/nuntium/">Nuntium</a> and <a href="http://instedd.org/technologies/verboice/">Verboice</a> technogies to expand the reach of the SMS and IVR capabilities of MOTECH applications.</p>

<h3>Implementation Partners</h3>
<h4><img src="/assets/logos/care.gif" alt="CARE"/></h4>
<p>CARE is a major participant in the Ananya effort in Bihar, India. Their team is re-engineering the training and supervision of the front line health workers in that state. They are using a combination of MOTECH and CommCare to better equip these health workers, collect data on the health care they deliver, and close the loop with patients who miss their schedule care.</p>
<h4><img src="/assets/logos/bbc.jpg" alt="BBC World Service Trust"/></h4>
<p>The BBC World Service Trust is also a major participant in the Ananya effort in Bihar, India. BBCWST is creating job aids and training materials which will be distributed to front line health workers via MOTECH.</p>
<h4><img src="/assets/logos/whp.gif" alt="World Health Partners"/></h4>
<p>World Health Partners runs a network of private francised health clinics in India. They will be using MOTECH to increase the range of services their clinics can perform, starting with reporting and adherence tracking of tuberculosis patients.</p>
<h4><img src="/assets/logos/jandj.gif" alt="Johnson & Johnson"/></h4>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson is deploying the Treatment and Mobile Alerts program in urban India. This project aims to increase the appointment and treatment adherence for patients on anti-retroviral regimens. </p>
<h4><img src="/assets/logos/grameen.png" alt="Grameen Foundation"/></h4>
<p>Grameen Foundation has deployed MOTECH in the Upper East Region of Ghana. This project launched in July, 2010 and is now being scaled up nationally.</p>
