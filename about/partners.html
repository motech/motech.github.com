<h3>Development partners</h3>
<h4>Dimagi</h4>

<p>Dimagi produces CommCare, a mobile phone form-based app which facilitates better interaction between health care workers and patients. The CommCare UI is a series of forms that walk the caregiver and patient through the information and questions to be covered for a specific appointment protocol. In addition to presenting information, CommCare can be used to input data about the patientâ€™s visit. CommCare runs on medium-low capability phones and higher end phones.</p>

<p>CommCareHQ is the server component which stores the data collected by the CommCare handset application. CommCareHQ communicates with MOTECH server to coordinate care between the two systems.</p>

<p>CommCare and MOTECH are currently partnering on work with CARE in Bihar. We expect to partner with them more as higher-end phones become more common.</p>

<h4>InSTEDD</h4>

<p>InSTEDD has several technogies which insulate application developers from the complexity of dealing with individual operator/aggregator IVR or SMS systems. We expect to partner with MOTECH in the future to provide simpler authoring of call/message flows.</p>
