title: MOTECH - Mobile Technology for Community Health
---

<div class="column-container clearfix">

<p>MOTECH addresses the challenge of evalutating a patient's history, comparing it to a prescribed schedule of care, and initiating messages between patients, caregivers, administrators, and external healthcare systems. Working with our partners, we expand the effectiveness of solutions built on MOTECH.</p>
<h3>Development partners</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.dimagi.com/">Dimagi</a> produces <a href="http://www.commcarehq.org/home/">CommCare</a>, a mobile phone-based job aid for community health workers which facilitates better interaction between health care workers and patients. The CommCare UI is a series of forms that walk the caregiver and patient through the information and questions to be covered for a specific appointment protocol. In addition to presenting information, CommCare can be used to input data about the patientâ€™s visit. CommCare runs on medium-low capability phones and higher end phones.</p>

<p>CommCareHQ is the server component which stores the data collected by the CommCare handset application. CommCareHQ communicates with MOTECH server to coordinate care between the two systems.</p> 

<p>CommCare and MOTECH perform complementary roles with CommCare facilitating interactions between CHW and client as well as CHW workforce management while MOTECH is responsible for messaging to clients and caregivers as well as connections to external healthcare systems. CommCare and MOTECH are currently partnering on work with CARE in Bihar.</p>

<p><a href="http://instedd.com/">InSTEDD</a> has several technogies which insulate application developers from the complexity of dealing with individual operator/aggregator IVR or SMS systems. Grameen is partnering with InSTEDD to connect their <a href="http://instedd.org/technologies/nuntium/">Nuntium</a> and <a href="http://instedd.org/technologies/verboice/">Verboice</a> technogies to expand the reach of the SMS and IVR capabilities of MOTECH applications.</p>
