<h3>Notable Implementations</h3>
<a name="ghana"></a><h4>Mobile Midwife &amp; Nurses Application – Ghana</h4>

<p>Pregnant women enrolled in the Mobile Midwife program receive IVR/SMS messages in their local language each week of their pregnancy informing them of healthy behaviors and reminding them to receive care (vaccinations, antenatal checkups, etc.) as specified by Ghana Health Services. Community Health Nurses use forms on low-end mobile phones to record which patients they have seen. When patients miss appointments, alerts are sent to the nurses so the nurses can follow up with the patients. Reports are generated for Ghana Health Service to track care provided to the community. </p>
<p>The MOTECH Ghana project has received recognition from many public health experts, including Bill Gates, <a href="http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2011/10/Impatient-Bloggers-News-of-the-Day">whose blog described it</a>, and concluded, "Can a cell phone save a life? It's extremely possible."</p>

<a name="TAMA"></a><h4>TAMA – Urban India</h4>

<p>IVR calls are made to HIV-positive patients reminding them of appointment and pill times. Patients can report their adherence with pill regimens or indicate they aren't able to take their medicine. Patients with side effect symptoms can get feedback on what to do about them so they can continue their treatment. Nurses have a web-based tool which allows them to view patient adherence data and input/view patient medical data.</p>

<a name="ananya"></a><h4>Ananya – Bihar, India</h4>

<p>The Ananya project in India is a constellation of services delivered by implementing partners CARE and BBC World Service Trust targeted at improving the effectiveness of healthcare workers and patients in Bihar, India. MOTECH and CommCare are used to deliver many of the Ananya services, including:</p>

<h5>Mobile Handset Application for Front Line Health Workers (FLWs)</h5>

<p>CARE has designed an innovation for case management by FLW throughout the continuum of care (starting from pregnancy till 2 years of age of the child) with the help of mobile handsets. Any pregnant mother or child less than one year of age can be enrolled as a ‘case’ in the system. Each case is tracked along the continuum of care with specific protocols devised by CARE on birth preparedness, delivery, postnatal period, exclusive breastfeeding, and complementary feeding till two years of age of the child. A CommCare handset application is developed by Dimagi as per protocols devised by CARE, which will be used by FLWs (ASHAs and AWWs) to facilitate better interactions with pregnant women or mothers during home visits. The application will help in sharing data between all the FLWs working in the same catchment area and their supervisors. Thus it will help in better coordination and in establishing more effective supervisory mechanism. This application will also help in organizing and planning the work for the FLW by creating home visit schedulers. The application has in-built checklist which will help FLWs to follow right protocol during their interaction with women. Different multi-media job-aids developed by BBCWST will also be integrated with the application to facilitate the counselling process. Data will be collected through mobile handsets during home visits and will be stored in MOTECH Suite. CommCareHQ keeps the client data synchronized between the handsets of the FLWs and their supervisors who serve the same client population. MOTECH Suite will be able to integrate the patient (client) information and case history external databases, such as the Mother Child Tracking System (MCTS) of the Government of Bihar. CARE India team is implementing this innovation in the Saharsa district of Bihar. A randomized control trial (RCT) is being carried out in 35 randomly selected health sub-centre areas involving nearly 600 FLWs, who will be using this handset application. The performance of these areas on different health outcome indicators will be compared against another 35 randomly selected ‘control’ sub-centre areas of the same district after a year of implementation. </p>

<h5>IVR Training tools for FLWs</h5>

<p>Frontline health workers can participate in an IVR-based training and certificate program powered by MOTECH. The BBCWST has created training content and quizzes which are presented in a series of phone calls. After completing the course, the frontline worker is given a completion certificate.</p>

<p>Bihar frontline health workers can improve the effectiveness of care they deliver to patients by using the IVR job aids developed by the BBC and delivered via IVR messages from MOTECH. When the health worker is with a client, she can access these messages on her phone and play them for herself and the patient to explain what the patient should do and reinforce the message the health worker gives to the patient.</p>


<p>The interface for connecting MOTECH with OnMobile, the aggregator used for the Ananya project, is documented in the <a href="/assets/specs/ananya_ivr_services_v1.pdf">Ananya IVR services document</a>.

<a name="kilkari"></a><h5>Kilkari</h5>

<p>Kilkari is very similar to Mobile Midwife in Ghana. Pregnant women enrolled in the Kilkari program receive IVR calls in their local language with BBCWST-created content reminding them of healthy behaviors and encouraging them to follow the schedule of care prescribed by the Government of Bihar for their pregnancy and the first two years of their child's life.</p>

<h4>World Health Partners TB Case Management</h4>

<p>Through their franchise-based clinics, World Health Partners diagnoses and treats a variety of ailments. They are using MOTECH to expand the range of services their franchisees can deliver, starting with tuberculosis. Using MOTECH, World Health Partner clinic operators can monitor and report on patient adherence to TB treatment. </p>
