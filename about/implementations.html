<h3>Current Implementations</h3>
<h4>Mobile Midwife &amp; Nurses Application – Ghana</h4>

<p>Pregnant women enrolled in the Mobile Midwife program receive IVR/SMS messages in their local language each week of their pregnancy informing them of healthy behaviors and reminding them to receive care (vaccinations, antenatal checkups, etc.) as specified by Ghana Health Services. Community Health Nurses use forms on low-end mobile phones to record which patients they have seen. When patients miss appointments, alerts are sent to the nurses so the nurses can follow up with the patients. Reports are generated for Ghana Health Service to track care provided to the community.</p>
<p>The MOTECH Ghana project has received recognition from many public health experts, including Bill Gates, <a href="http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2011/10/Impatient-Bloggers-News-of-the-Day">whose blog described it</a>, and concluded, "Can a cell phone save a life? It's extremely possible."</p>

<h4>TAMA – Urban India</h4>

<p>IVR calls are made to HIV-positive patients reminding them of appointment and pill times. Patients can report their adherence with pill regimens or indicate they aren't able to take their medicine. Patients with side effect symptoms can get feedback on what to do about them so they can continue their treatment. Nurses have a web-based tool which allows them to view patient adherence data and input/view patient medical data.</p>

<p>To see an overview of the TAMA system, watch the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYcX22-09Tc">TAMA video</a>. To learn more about the features of the system, read the <a href="/assets/specs/TAMA Use case Overview.pdf">TAMA overview presentation</a>. </p>
<h4>Ananya – Bihar, India</h4>

<p>The Ananya project in India is a constellation of services delivered by implementing partners CARE and BBC World Service Trust targeted at improving the effectiveness of healthcare workers and patients in Bihar, India. MOTECH and CommCare are used to deliver many of the Ananya services, including:</p>

<h5>Mobile Handset Application for Front Line Health Workers (FLWs)</h5>

<p>A CommCare handset application is used by community health workers (ASHAs and AWWs) to facilitate better interactions for high-priority protocols. As data is collected on the handset it is passed to CommCareHQ and then to MOTECH. CommCareHQ keeps the patient data synchronized between the handsets of the frontline health care workers who serve the same patient population. MOTECH provides a web UI for the Government of Bihar to define the care schedule that should be followed. MOTECH sends messages to frontline workers reminding them of the tasks they need to complete (patients due for care, patients due to deliver, patients overdue for care, etc.). CommCare presents referral information to caregiver/patient when the caregiver refers the patient to another facility or provider such as transportation.</p>

<h5>IVR Training tools for FLWs</h5>

<p>Frontline health workers can participate in an IVR-based training and certificate program powered by MOTECH. The BBCWST has created training content and quizzes which are presented in a series of phone calls. After completing the course, the frontline worker is given a completion certificate.</p>

<p>Bihar frontline health workers can improve the effectiveness of care they deliver to patients by using the IVR job aids developed by the BBC and delivered via IVR messages from MOTECH. When the health worker is with a client, she can access these messages on her phone and play them for herself and the patient to explain what the patient should do and reinforce the message the health worker gives to the patient.</p>

<p>The interface for connecting MOTECH with OnMobile, the aggregator used for the Ananya project, is documented in the <a href="/assets/specs/ananya_ivr_services_v1.pdf">Ananya IVR services document</a>.
</p>
<h5>Kilkari</h5>

<p>Kilkari is very similar to Mobile Midwife in Ghana. Pregnant women enrolled in the Kilkari program receive IVR calls in their local language with BBCWST-created content reminding them of healthy behaviors and encouraging them to follow the schedule of care prescribed by the Government of Bihar for their pregnancy and the first two years of their child's life.</p>

<h4>World Health Partners TB Case Management</h4>

<p>Through their franchise-based clinics, World Health Partners diagnoses and treats a variety of ailments. They are using MOTECH to expand the range of services their franchisees can deliver, starting with tuberculosis. Using MOTECH, World Health Partner clinic operators can monitor and report on patient adherence to TB treatment. </p>
