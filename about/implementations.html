<h3>Current Implementations</h3>
<h4>Mobile Midwife – Ghana</h4>

<p>Pregnant women enrolled in the program receive IVR/SMS messages each week of their pregnancy informing them of healthy behavior and reminding them to receive care (vaccinations, antenatal checkups, etd.) as specified by Ghana Health Services. Community Health Nurses use forms on low-end mobile phones to record which patients they have seen. When patients miss appointments, alerts are sent to the nurses so the nurses can track down the patients. Reports are generated for Ghana Health Service to track care provided to the community.</p>
<h4>TAMA – Urban India</h4>

<p>IVR messages to HIV-positive patients reminding them of appointments and pill times. Ability for patients to report adherence to the pill regimen and get information about how to deal with their side-effects. Web-based tool which allows nurses/doctors to view patient adherence data and input/view patient medical data.</p>
<h4>Ananya – Bihar, India</h4>

<p>The Ananya project in India is a constellation of services targeted at healthcare workers and patients in Bihar, India. MOTECH is used in many of the Ananya services, including:</p>

<h4><i>Mobile Handset Application for Front Line Health Workers (FLWs)</i></h4>

<p>A CommCare handset application is used by community health workers (ASHAs and AWWs) to facilitate better interactions for high-priority protocols. As data is collected on the handset it is passed to CommCareHQ and then to MOTECH. CommCareHQ keeps the patient data synchronized between the handsets of the ASHA and AWW who serve the same patient population. MOTECH provides a web UI for GoB or CARE staff members to define the care schedule that should be followed. MOTECH sends messages to ASHA/AWW reminding them of the tasks they need to complete (patients due for care, patients due to deliver, patients overdue for care, etc.). CommCare presents referral information to caregiver/patient when the caregiver refers the patient to another facility or provider such as transportation.</p>

<h4><i>IVR Training tools for FLWs</i></h4>

<p>IVR-based Training for ASHAs. After completing the course, the ASHA receives a certificate showing her completion.</p>

<p>IVR-based Job Aids for ASHAs/AWW. The health worker can play these at an appointment to provide information about what the patient should do and to reinforce the message the health worker is giving the patient.</p>
<h4>Kilkari</h4>

<p>Kilkari is very similar to Mobile Midwife in Ghana. Messages are sent to pregnant women and their families reminding them of healthy behaviors and encouraging them to follow the schedule of care prescribed by the GoB.
World Health Partners TB Case Management</p>

<p>Through their franchise-based clinics, World Health Partners diagnoses and treats TB patients. Initially, they want to use MOTECH to allow caregivers to report on a patient’s adherence to their TB regimen. (This is similar to TAMA, except the reporting is done by the caregiver, not the patient.)</p>
