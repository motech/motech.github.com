<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>While MOTECH SUITE applications can work with anonymous users the most effective applications use a registration process to better tailor messages to individual users, close the loop between giving information and recording that the appropriate action was taken, and enabling more effective reporting.</p>

<h3>Why Registration is Important</h3>
<p>Patient identification is at the core of delivering more effective healthcare.  FLW registration is required to monitor healthcare worker effectiveness and improve and coordinate care among different actors in the health system.</p>

<h3>Key MOTECH SUITE Registration Capabilities</h3>
<p>Currently, MOTECH does not have a registration module since registration is handled very differently in different regions. MOTECH does provide a flexible schema and mechanisms for connecting custom registration systems with the full collection of MOTECH modules.  Some examples from current implementations include:</p>

<dl style="margin-left: 15px">
	<dt><h4>Ghana</h4></dt>
	  <dd style="margin-left: 15px"><p>MOTECH Ghana collects patient registration using the MOTECH mobile forms module.  Custom code process the form submission and records patients in OpenMRS and registers them in the MOTECH Message Campaign module.  MOTECH is then able to track the individual patients care and message them at times specific to their care plan.</p></dd>

	<dt><h4>Bihar</h4></dt>
	  <dd style="margin-left: 15px"><p>The BBC uses MOTECH in Bihar to register FLWs through an IVR application and a call center.</p></dd> 

	<dt><h4>TAMA</h4></dt>
	  <dd style="margin-left: 15px"><p>MOTECH Tama uses a custom UI to register patients, doctors and nurses in MOTECH's CouchDB.  It then connects the data records using existing MOTECH modules to track user appointments (Appointment Module), remind them to take pills (Pill Reminder Module) and track adherence.</p></dd>
