							      <h4>Ways to Contribute</h4>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li><b>Website</b> - This site can use a lot of work.  We'd love to tell our story, perhaps you can help.</li>
                                    <li><b>Documentation</b> - We've got a lot of code, but not a lot of documentation.  Any help here is greatly appreciated</li>
                                    <li><b>Setup</b> - Know <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a> or <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">chef</a>?  We could use help getting some recipes in place to make installation easier.</li>
                                    <li><b>UI/UX</b> - We've got some big plans around making Motech extremely simple for end users to administer.  We could really use some help firming up these plans and then delivering on them.</li>
                                    <li><b>Development</b> - We've got a long list of tasks that we're working our way through.  We need help developing new modules, new telephony adapters and could really use an OSGI expert to help us solidify our module system.</li>
