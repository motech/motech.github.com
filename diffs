 		<p>In order to use the demo, you must register a patient into Motech with a valid phone number (no symbols, it should look like 2074503879)
 		This same patient ID must also be registered into OpenMRS. You may then enroll that patient in the schedule from the scheduleTracking page. If an enrolled patient is not found in BOTH the demo's Motech phone number database and in Open MRS, they will not be enrolled in the schedule.</p>

 		<p>Milestones have "windows" which represent a period of time. For example, today through five days from now represents a five day window. In the demo, each milestone has the same window periods. 0-1 minutes is the "early" window and no messages or alerts are raised.</p>
