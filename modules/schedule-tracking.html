    <h3>Schedule Tracking Module</h3>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>The schedule tracking module allows a client to be enrolled in a clearly defined schedule. Schedules consist of specified 
"milestones." Milestones represent windows of time in which certain criteria, treatments, courses, etc. should be fulfilled 
before moving on to the next milestone. Clients enrolled in these schedules are sent alerts when they are due, late, or 
past due on the period of schedule fulfillment. Clients may be enrolled in an unlimited number of schedules, but they can only be 
active in one enrollment for a given schedule.</p>

    <h4>Information for Implementation</h4>

    <p>A schedule defines a set of milestones that should be fulfilled in specified windows of time. 
Implementers can use the schedule tracking module to accomplish the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Enroll a particular client in a schedule for a specific duration. This is accomplished by means of the schedule 
	tracking service.</li>
      <li>Send alerts to clients that have been enrolled in a schedule.</li>
      <li>Define JSON documents that specify a schedule and its set of milestones.</li>
      <li>Query for client enrollments in schedules based on specific criteria.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Client enrollments are stored in CouchDB.</p>

    <h4>Life Cycle of a Milestone</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first milestone is triggered at the start of the schedule. Subsequent milestones are started when the previous 
	milestone is fulfilled.</li>
        <li>Once started, a milestone is in an <em>earliest</em>, <em>due</em>, <em>late</em>, or <em>max</em> 
	window as per the schedule configuration. These window durations form the lifetime of the milestone.</li>
        <li>A milestone can be defaulted within its lifetime.</li>
        <li>If a milestone is not fulfilled before the expiration of its lifetime, the associated client enrollment 
	will be defaulted, and all of the previously configured alerts will not be raised.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Specifying a Schedule and its Milestones</h4>
    <p>Specifying the characteristics of a schedule and its milestones is typically accomplished using a JSON 
(JavaScript Object Notation) document. The <strong>schedule_tracking.properties</strong> file specifies the directory
 to scan for schedule definitions. Any JSON file in the directory will be treated as a schedule definition. Multiple schedules 
can be defined, each in their own file. Schedules have a name and a list of milestones. A milestone has: 
<ul>
	<li>A name</li>
	<li>A list of four standard time windows (<em>earliest</em>, <em>due</em>, <em>late</em>, and <em>max</em>)</li>
	<li>A list of alerts.</li>
 	<li>A map of data (not currently used)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Window durations can be customized.</p>

    <h4>Sample Schedule Definition</h4>
    <p>Below is an example JSON definition file for a single schedule.</p>

<img src="/assets/modules/ExampleSchedule.PNG"/>

<p>The schedule has a name, IPTI Schedule. There are two distinct milestones specified within
 the schedule, each specifying four different windows of time. The value specified for a window 
indicates when that window will end in respect to the start of the milestone.</p>

<p>The first milestone, IPTI 1, will spend its first 13 weeks in a waiting status called the <em>earliest</em> window. 
1 week will be spent in the <em>due</em> window (the reference to "14 weeks" is relative to start of milestone). 
2 months after the start of IPTI 1, the <em>late</em> window will elapse. The <em>max</em> window has no duration 
(see the <b>Specifying Times</b> section for more details about time values in the schedule definition). Because no 
maximum period is defined, as soon as the <em>late</em> period is entered, the enrollment's status will be set to defaulted. </p>

<p>While the milestone is in the <em>due</em> window, one alert per day will be sent to the client at the 
preferred time specified at the time of enrollment. Once in the <em>late</em> window, one alert per week is sent
 except for the first week. If no preferred time is specified, all alerts will be raised exactly as per 
their offset from the date and time of enrollment.</p>

<p>The second milestone, named "IPTI 2," will begin when the first milestone has been fulfilled. All of the 
window configurations in the second milestone begin with respect to the start of the second milestone. IPTI 2 will spend 1 week in
the <em>earliest</em> window. It will also spend 1 week in the <em>due</em> window. </p>

<p>Both milestones define data that will be included in the alert event payload. 
Implementers may pass any data they wish to send when the alert event is raised.</p>

    <h4>Specifying Window Times</h4>

    <p>Time values in the schedule definition are specified in the following format.</p>
	<p><em>number  unit</em></p>
	<p>where:</p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>number</em> is any number</p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>unit</em> is any of year, month, week, day, hour, minute or second. </p>
<p>Plural forms of units can also be used (i.e. days, months, etc.) Note that durations involving year and month might 
not remain consistent: a month might have 28, 30, or 31 days, and a year may have 365 or 366 days. The actual duration 
of these units depends on the reference date around which the windows are defined.</p>

<p>Examples of time values:</p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 Day, 4 Weeks</p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days</p>
	
<p>As seen above, multiple time values can be combined together as a JSON array to result in a period 
that represents the sum of all values in the array. For example, ["2 Weeks", "3 Days"] represents a period equivalent to 17 days.</p>

<p>An empty string normally means a zero duration; however, if a window is defined with an empty duration,
this DOES NOT mean that the window is triggered at the start of the milestone. An empty string simply indicates that the associated
window has no duration.</p>

<h4>Absolute Window Schedules</h4>

<p>Implementers may define an Absolute window schedule if they wish to schedule all milestones 
and alerts in reference to the start of the schedule.Unlike regular schedules, absolute schedules 
do not depend on milestone windows.</p>

<p>An example milestone and alert configuration for an absolute window schedule is given below.</p>

        {% highlight javascript %}
        {
            "name":"Absolute Schedule",
            "absolute": true,
            "milestones":[
                {
                    "name":"milestone1",
                    "scheduleWindows":{
                        "earliest":["1 Week"],
                        "due":["2 Weeks"],
                        "late":["3 Weeks"],
                        "max":[""]
                    },
                    "data":{
                        "Foo":"Bar"
                    },
                    "alerts":[
                        {
                            "window":"earliest",
                            "offset":["0 Weeks"],
                            "interval":["1 Day"],
                            "count":"7"
                        },
                        {
                            "window":"late",
                            "offset":["2 Week", "4 hours"],
                            "interval":["1 Week"],
                            "count":"51"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "name":"milestone2",
                    "scheduleWindows":{
                        "earliest":["5 Weeks"],
                        "due":["6 Weeks"],
                        "late":["7 Weeks"],
                        "max":["8 Weeks"]
                    },
                    "data":{
                        "doo":"Bar"
                    },
                    "alerts":[
                        {
                            "window":"earliest",
                            "offset":["4 Weeks"],
                            "interval":["1 Day"],
                            "count":"7"
                        },
                        {
                            "window":"max",
                            "offset":["7 Weeks", "1 Day"],
                            "interval":["1 Day"],
                            "count":"7"
                        }

                    ]
                }
            ]
        }

        {% endhighlight %}
       

<p>The milestone named "milestone2" has its <em>earliest</em> window configuration of 5 weeks. 
These 5 weeks are referenced from the start of the schedule, NOT from the time when the 
first milestone, milestone1, was fulfilled. Similarly, the alert configuration for the <em>late</em> window 
of milestone1 of 2 weeks, 4 hours is with respect to the start of schedule, NOT with respect to the start of the <em>late window.</em></p>

<p>In order to configure an absolute window alert, implementers should indicate the following in the configuration of the schedule:</p>
        {% highlight java %}
         "absolute": true
         {% endhighlight %}

<p>If no such line exists, the default is to create a schedule that is not absolute.</p>

   
 <h4>Alerts</h4>

<p>Alert times can be specified in a manner similar to window times; however, 
variable duration units (month and year) are not allowed. MoTeCH scheduling logic is deeply rooted in fixed 
repeating intervals, and therefore support for variable duration units for alerts is undefined.</p>

<p>In addition, alert scheduling includes support for minute and second units so that short-lived 
schedules can be created, which is handy for testing.</p>


<p>NOTE: All time intervals are left-closed, right-open. For example, in the below alert configuration, 
if the <em>earliest</em> window duration is "1 Week," then alerts will be raised on the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th days; 
yet, no alerts will be raised on the 7th day.</p>

 {%highlight javascript%}
"alerts":[
        {
            "window":"earliest",
            "offset":["3 Days"],
            "interval":["1 Day"],
            "count":"7"
         }
]
 {%endhighlight%}

 <p>The schedule tracking module can be configured to raise alerts during each window. 
Consider the following alerts section of a schedule configuration.</p>

      {%highlight javascript%}
        "alerts":[
            {
                "window":"earliest",
                "offset":["0 Weeks"],
                "interval":["1 Day"],
                "count":"7"
            },
            {
                "window":"late",
                "offset":["2 Week", "4 hours"],
                "interval":["1 Week"],
                "count":"51"
            }
        ]
      {%endhighlight%}


      <p>This module raises alerts during the <em>earliest</em> and <em>late</em> windows of the milestone. 
The <em>"offset"</em> specifies the amount of time that will pass from the alert reference time to when the alert is raised.</p>

        <p>The alert reference time is computed as follows:</p>

      <p><u>If the schedule is absolute:</u></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The alert reference time is the start of the schedule. All offsets for alerts are calculated from the start of schedule.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><u>If the schedule is not absolute:</u></p>
      <ul>
        <li>If there are no fulfilled milestones, the enrollment date is used as the alert reference time.</li>
        <li>If there are fulfilled milestones, the last milestone's fulfillment date is used as the alert reference time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <em>interval</em> is the time interval between two consecutive alerts.</p>

      <p>The <em>count</em> is the total number of alerts that should be raised; yet, window 
duration takes precedence over the <em>count</em>. If a window's duration has elapsed, the
 module will not raise any more alerts, and the <em>count</em> will remain unsatisfied. </p>

      <h4>Floating Alerts</h4>
      <p>A floating alert is one in which alert times can be raised as long as the window 
duration is not elapsed. In this case, the enrollment date is used as the alert reference time. 
Alerts are scheduled from the time of enrollment until the end of the window. </p>

<p>Alerts can be configured as floating by providing the below parameter in the alert configuration.</p>
       
 {%highlight javascript%}
        "floating":"true"
{%endhighlight%}

<p>Consider a case where the alert configuration is as follows:</p>

{%highlight javascript%}
            "alerts":[
                {
                    "window":"earliest",
                    "offset":["1 Day"],
                    "interval":["1 Day"],
                    "count":"1"
                }
            ]
{%endhighlight%}

<p>The above is a normal alert configuration. The value specified for the window indicates 
when that current window will end in respect to the start of the milestone. Consider that the 
<em>earliest</em> window duration has been set to 1 week. If the enrollment does not occur until the 
middle of the week, say day 4, then any alerts would have already elapsed at the time of enrollment. 

{%highlight javascript%}
"alerts":[
	{
                    "window":"earliest",
                    "offset":["1 Day"],
                    "interval":["1 Day"],
                    "count":"1"
	  "floating": "true"
	}
]
{%endhighlight%}

<p>The above is a floating alert configuration. Consider again that the <em>earliest</em> window duration 
has been set to 1 week. Even if the enrollment happens in the middle of the week, say day 4, an alert would still be raised on day 5 
(considering the offset is 1 day), as the <em>earliest</em> window would not have not elapsed yet.

<p>NOTE: By default, the floating value is false.</p>

 
    <h4>Enrolling a user in a schedule</h4>

    <p>The schedule tracking module exposes the interface ScheduleTrackingService.</p>

<img src="/assets/modules/ScheduleTrackingService.PNG"/>


<p>To enroll a user into a schedule, an EnrollmentRequest must be passed to 
the enroll() method in the ScheduleTrackingService. An EnrollmentRequest has the following information:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>externalId (String)</dt>  <dd>A unique ID of the client.</dd>
      <dt>scheduleName (String)</dt>  <dd>The name of the schedule the user will be enrolled in (defined in the JSON document).</dd>
      <dt>startingMilestoneName (String)</dt>  <dd>The name of the first milestone into which the user will be directly enrolled.</dd>
      <dt>referenceDate (LocalDate)</dt>  <dd>The date on which the schedule will start.</dd>
      <dt>referenceTime (Time)</dt>  <dd>An optional time component that can be specified for fine grained referencing (defaults to midnight).</dd>
      <dt>enrollmentDate (LocalDate)</dt>  <dd>The date on which the user is enrolled into the schedule.</dd>
      <dt>enrollmentTime (Time)</dt>  <dd>An optional time component that can be specified for fine grained enrolling (defaults to midnight).</dd>
      <dt>preferredAlertTime (Time)</dt>  <dd>The time of day, in hours and minutes, that the user should be sent alerts.</dd>
      <dt>metadata (Map&lt;String, String&gt;)</dt>  <dd>Additional information can be stored in metadata as property => value pair. eg: facility_id => 1234</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>When the ScheduleTrackingService's enroll() method is invoked, the service determines whether that client is already 
enrolled and active in the schedule. If the client is already enrolled, the service overwrites the previous enrollment with the new one. 
A new enrollment record for the client is created and added to the database.</p>

    <h4>Events consumed and emitted by the Schedule Tracking Module</h4>

    <h5>Consumed Events:</h5>
<p>This module exposes an EndOfMilestoneListener, which handles and consumes events with the subject 
EventSubjects.DEFAULTMENT_CAPTURE.</p>

{% highlight java %}
    EventSubjects.DEFAULTMENT_CAPTURE (org.motechproject.scheduletracking.api.defaultment.capture)
	Parameters/Payload:
		EventDataKeys.ENROLLMENT_ID (enrollmentId)
		EventDataKeys.EXTERNAL_ID (externalId)
		MotechSchedulerService.JOB_ID_KEY (jobId)
{% endhighlight %}


<h5>Emitted Events:</h5>
<p>The EnrollmentAlertService emits events with the subject EventSubjects.MILESTONE_ALERT.</p>

{% highlight java %}
EventSubjects.MILESTONE_ALERT (org.motechproject.scheduletracking.api.milestone.alert)
    Parameters/Payload:
    	EventDataKeys.WINDOW_NAME (windowName)
     	EventDataKeys.MILESTONE_NAME (milestoneAlert);
    	EventDataKeys.SCHEDULE_NAME (scheduleName);
    	EventDataKeys.EXTERNAL_ID (externalId);
    	EventDataKeys.REFERENCE_DATE (referenceDateTime);
{% endhighlight %}


<p>Milestone alert events are scheduled for the current milestone per each alert definition.</p>

<p>The EnrollmentDefaultmentService emits events with the subject EventSubjects.DEFAULTMENT_CAPTURE.</p>

{% highlight java %}
    EventSubjects.DEFAULTMENT_CAPTURE (org.motechproject.scheduletracking.api.defaultment.capture)
	Parameters/Payload:
		EventDataKeys.ENROLLMENT_ID (enrollmentId)
		EventDataKeys.EXTERNAL_ID (externalId)
		MotechSchedulerService.JOB_ID_KEY (jobId)
{% endhighlight %}

,p>Defaultment jobs are scheduled on the day a milestone would be defaulted. Their role is to capture and save the 
defaulted state of the milestone.</p>

   <h4>Fulfilling milestones</h4>

<p>The fulfillCurrentMilestone() method of the module's ScheduleTrackingService fulfills the current milestone 
of the client within an enrollment. After fulfillment of a milestone, the client moves to the next milestone in the schedule. 
If no more milestones remain the schedule, the enrollment is marked as complete. This fulfillment date and time is mandatory 
while fulfilling a milestone. The fulfillment date and time are used to make the fulfillment process idempotent. 
This ensures that invoking fulfillCurrentMilestone() more than once with the same fulfillment date and time will not make 
multiple fulfillments.</p>

    <h4>Defaulted enrollments</h4>

    <p>For any milestone in an enrollment, if the milestone has not been fulfilled by the last day of the milestone, then that 
enrollment is marked as defaulted. The last day of the milestone is the day when all four windows of the milestone elapse.
A defaulted enrollment will not raise any more alerts. It also cannot move to an active state, which is the default state of 
an enrollment that raises alerts.</p>

    <h4>Unenrolling a user from a schedule</h4>

<p>The unenroll() method of the module's ScheduleTrackingService removes a user from an active enrollment. 
Only active enrollments can be removed. Envoking unenroll() on an enrollment will cause the enrollment to be marked as 
<em>UNENROLLED</em> in the database. <em>DEFAULTED</em> and <em>COMPLETED</em> enrollments are also preserved 
in the database for record keeping.</p>

    <h4>Updating an active enrollment</h4>

<p>The updateEnrollment() method of the module's ScheduleTrackingService updates an active enrollment. 
Currently, MoTeCH supports updating only the metadata field of an active enrollment. Metadata property => 
value pair can be updated or inserted but cannot be deleted from an existing enrollment.</p>
<p> Example:<br/>
Consider an active enrollment with the following attributes:</p>

<p>&nsbp; &nsbp;&nsbp; external id : "foo"</p>
<p>&nsbp; &nsbp;&nsbp; schedule name : "some_schedule"</p>
<p>&nsbp; &nsbp;&nsbp; metadata value pairs : {foo1: bar1; foo2: bar2}</p>

{% highlight java %}
HashMap<String, String> toBeUpdatedMetadata = new HashMap<String, String>();
toBeUpdatedMetadata.put("foo2", "val2");
toBeUpdatedMetadata.put("foo3", "val3");
UpdateCriteria updateCriteria = new UpdateCriteria().Metadata(toBeUpdatedMetadata);
scheduleTrackingService.updateEnrollment("foo", "some_schedule", updateCriteria);
{% endhighlight %}

<p> will update the metadata of the enrollment as {foo1:bar1; foo2: val2; foo3: val3}</p>

<h4>Previewing Alert Timings</h4>

<p>The getAlertTimings() method of the module's ScheduleTrackingService provides a preview 
of alert timings given a particular enrollment request. For the given enrollment request, the alert 
timings of all windows of the current milestone will be returned. This gives an idea of the alerts that 
a client might miss if the enrollment were to be scheduled on the date specified by the enrollment request. 
This is useful in cases where the client needs to be enrolled into the middle of the milestone but should not miss any alerts.
After previewing the alert timings, clients would be enrolled on a reference date that results in a schedule with no elapsed alerts.</p>

<h4>Querying the API</h4>

<p>The search() method of the module's ScheduleTrackingService allows for querying enrollments. 
This allows clients to find enrollments using various criteria. Queries can be performed based on the following list of criteria: </p>

<ul>
	<li>havingExternalId(externalId)</li>
	<li>havingSchedule(scheduleNames...)</li>
	<li>havingCurrentMilestone(milestoneName)</li>
	<li>havingWindowStartingDuring(WindowName, DateTime start, DateTime end)</li>
	<li>havingWindowEndingDuring(WindowName, DateTime start, DateTime end)</li>
	<li>currentlyInWindow(WindowNames...)</li>
	<li>havingState(EnrollmentStatus)</li>	(<em>ACTIVE</em>, <em>DEFAULTED</em>, COMPLETED</em>, or <em>UNENROLLED</em>)
	<li>completedDuring(DateTime start, DateTime end)</li>
	<li>havingMetadata(key, value)</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these methods returns an EnrollmentsQuery object, which the search() method takes as a parameter. </p>

<p>Examples:</p>

{% highlight java %}
scheduleTrackingService.search(new EnrollmentsQuery().havingState("active"))
{% endhighlight %}

<p>will find all active enrollments.</p>

{% highlight java %}
scheduleTrackingService.search(
	new EnrollmentsQuery()
		.havingSchedule("IPTI Schedule")
		.havingState("active")
		.havingWindowStartingDuring(WindowName.due, weeksAgo(1), now))
{% endhighlight %}

<p>will find active enrollments enrolled into the IPTI Schedule that will enter the <em>due</em> window any time in the 
next one week. </p>

<p>The return value of the search() method is a list of EnrollmentRecords. An EnrollmentRecord represents an enrollment 
in the system. EnrollmentRecords contain an external id, schedule name, preferred alert time, reference date and time, enrollment 
date and time, start dates for each of the four windows, and a reference to the current milestone.</p>
