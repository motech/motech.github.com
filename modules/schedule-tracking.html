    <h3>Schedule Tracking Module</h3>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The schedule tracking module allows a client to be enrolled in a clearly defined schedule consisting of specified milestones. Milestones represent windows of time that a certain criteria, treatment, course, etc should be fulfilled before moving on to the next milestone. Alerts are sent to the enrolled clients when they are due, late or past on the period of fulfillment. Clients may be enrolled in unlimited schedules, but can only be enrolled once in any given schedule.</p>

    <h3>Information for implementation</h3>

    <p>Schedules define a set of milestones that should be fulfilled in specified windows of time. Implementers can use the module to accomplish the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use a schedule tracking service that allows a specific client to be enrolled into a specific schedule for its duration</li>
      <li>Send alerts to clients that have been enrolled in a schedule</li>
      <li>Define JSON documents that specify a schedule and its set of milestones</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Enrollments are stored in CouchDB.</p>

    <h3>Specifying a schedule and its milestones</h3>
    <p>Specifying the characteristics of a schedule and its milestones is typically accomplished using a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) document. The scheduletracking.properties file specifies the location and name of the JSON schedule definitions file. Schedules have a name, total duration and list of milestones. Milestones have names, reference dates, schedule windows, data and custom alerts (which may be defined, but are currently unused). Below is an example of a JSON schedule definition.</p>

    <h3>Enrolling a user in a campaign</h3>

    <p>The schedule tracking module exposes a ScheduleTrackingService with one method, enroll. To enroll a user in a schedule, an EnrollRequest must be passed to the enroll method in the service. EnrollRequests consist of the following information:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>externalId (String)</dt>  <dd>A unique ID of the client.</dd>
      <dt>scheduleName (String)</dt>  <dd>The name of the schedule defined in the JSON document to be enrolled in.</dd>
      <dt>enrolledInMilestone (String)</dt>  <dd>Currently unused by the module.</dd>
      <dt>enrolledAt (int)</dt>  <dd>Currently unused by the module.</dd>
      <dt>preferredAlertTime (Time)</dt>  <dd>The time of day, in hours and minutes, the user should be sent alerts.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>When enroll is invoked, the service determines whether that client is already enrolled in the schedule. If they are, the service does not attempt to schedule any new jobs for them and returns. If they are not already enrolled in the schedule, a new enrollment for that user is created and added to the database. Daily jobs for that user-schedule relationship are scheduled to fire every day at the preferred time. When the job is triggered and the event is fired, the system checks if there are any applicable alerts to send out. If there are, the system sends an alert event that needs to be handled.</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Below is an example JSON definition file for a single schedule. The schedule has a name, IPTI Schedule, and a total duration of 52 weeks. There are two distinct milestones specified within the schedule. The first, IPTI 1, will spend its first 92 days in waiting status, until it enters the "earliest" window. One week will be spent in upcoming status, and two weeks will be spent in due status. Due to no maximum period being defined, as soon as the late period is entered, the milestone's status will be set to past. While the milestone is in due, late or past status, one alert per day will be sent to the client at the preferred time they were enrolled with.</p>

    <p>The second milestone spends eight days waiting, a week in upcoming, and a week in due. After that, there is once again no late period, so the milestone's status is set to past. The entire schedule runs for 52 weeks. When 52 weeks have elapsed since enrollment, alerts are stopped.</p>

    <p>Both milestones define data that is included in the scheduled payload. The first milestone has custom alerts, which currently are not used for raising alerts.</p>

    <h4>Events consumed and emitted by the schedule tracking module</h4>

    <h3>Consumed events:</h3>

    <p>ScheduleTrackingEventService handles and consumes the following keyed event(s):</p>

    {% highlight java %}
    EventKeys.ENROLLED_ENTITY_REGULAR_ALERT (raiseAlertForEnrolledEntity method)
    Parameters/Payload:
      SCHEDULE_NAME_KEY (scheduleName) - String
      ENROLLMENT_ID (externalId) - String
      JOB_ID_KEY (externalId) - String
    {% endhighlight %}


    <h3>Emitted events:</h3>

    <p>ScheduleTrackingEventService emits the following keyed event(s):</p>

    {% highlight java %}
    EventKeys.ENROLLED_ENTITY_MILESTONE_ALERT
    This event is emitted by the tracking event service when an alert needs to be sent out and handled. Checks for alerts are made per user, per schedule on a daily basis.
    Parameters/Payload:
      WINDOW_NAME (alert.windowName)
      MILESTONE_NAME (alert.milestoneName)
      Also included are all the data parameters from the alert as specified in the JSON document.
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>ScheduleTrackingServiceImpl emits the following keyed event(s):</p>

    {% highlight java %}
    EventKeys.ENROLLED_ENTITY_REGULAR_ALERT 
    This event is emitted by the scheduler. It originates from the enroll method in the schedule tracking service implementation.
    Parameters/Payload:
      SCHEDULE_NAME_KEY (scheduleName) - String
      ENROLLMENT_ID (externalId) - String
      JOB_ID_KEY (externalId) - String
    {% endhighlight %}

    <h4>Questions regarding the schedule tracking module:</h4>

    <p>Alert configurations are specified in the JSON document and properly read into MilestoneWindows, as expected. However, the way alerts are currently sent does not incorporate these configurations whatsoever. Regardless of any custom alerts that have been defined, one alert will be sent per day during the Due, Late and Past periods of a milestone, until it is fulfilled or the schedule's duration has elapsed.</p>

    <p>The service provides only one functionality, enroll. It seems there should be, at the very least, an unenroll method, and possibly reenroll.</p>

    <p>When alerts are raised, an event with ENROLLED_ENTITY_MILESTONE_ALERT as its key is emitted to the outbound gateway. It appears that nothing in the platform handles this method. Where should this responsibility lie; the schedule tracking modules, another module, or defined by an implementer?</p>

    <p>A minor point: MilestoneEvents and EnrolledEntityAlertEvents have their keys defined within the class, rather than in the EventKeys class. This seems to run contrary to the design found in other modules.</p>

    <p>Another minor point: EnrollmentFactory is an empty class. Is there a future for this, or is it a relic?
    There are some other issues (no ability for an end user to specify when a milestone has been fulfilled) but these are captured in Mingle stories.</p>
