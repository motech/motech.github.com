    <h3> Module</h3> 

    <h4>Description</h4> 
<p>The SMS-SMPP module is an SMS implementation that handles send SMS events that were raised by the SMS-API module. Its purpose is to send SMS messages over SMPP to a specified SMS provider that is responsible for dispatching the message.</p>

    <h4>Information for implementation</h4> 
<p>The SMS-SMPP module should be deployed alongside the SMS-API module. An implementation should use the SMS service provided by the SMS-API module in order to send their messages. These message events are handled by the SMPP module. The SMPP module sends the message over SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer). The implementer never directly calls this module.</p>

    <h4>Configuration</h4>
<p>An implementer must configure an smpp.properties file like the one found in the test resources folder. This file describes the SMPP server along with authentication details. An example template is provided below:</p>

{% highlight java %}
host=your.smpp.server
port=2775
system_id=pavel
password=wpsd	
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This means the smpp server runs on the host your.smpp.server over port 2775. A user 'pavel' with password 'wpsd' is registered on the server.</p>

    <h3>Events consumed and emitted by the SMS-SMPP module</h3>

    <h4>Consumed events:</h4>
{% highlight java %}
Subject: EventSubjects.SEND_SMS ("SendSMS")
Payload:
EventDataKeys.RECIPIENTS ("number") mapped to a List<String>
EventDataKeys.MESSAGE ("message") mapped to a String
EventDataKeys.DELIVERY_TIME ("delivery_time") mapped to a DateTime
{% endhighlight %}
This event will be emitted by the sms-api module. The SMPP module will send an sms to all the recipients with given message, both being defined in the payload of the event. In addition a delivery time can also be specified in which case the message will be scheduled to be sent out at the specified time.

    <h4>Emitted events:</h4>
{% highlight java %}
Subject: EventSubjects.SMS_DELIVERY_REPORT
Payload:
EventDataKeys.SENDER ("sender") mapped to a String
EventDataKeys.STATUS_MESSAGE ("status_message") mapped to a String
EventDataKeys.TIMESTAMP ("timestamp") mapped to DateTime
{% endhighlight %}
This event will be emitted by the module when the SMSC notifies the module with the delivery status of an outbound message.

{% highlight java %}
Subject: EventSubjects.SMS_FAILURE_NOTIFICATION
Payload:
EventDataKeys.RECIPIENT ("number") mapped to a String
EventDataKeys.MESSAGE ("message") mapped to a String
{% endhighlight %}
This event will be emitted by the module in the case the delivery of a message has failed. If the original send request had multiple recipients and the delivery fails for each one of them then individual events will be raised for each of the recipient.

{% highlight java %}
Subject: EventSubjects.INBOUND_SMS
Payload:
EventDataKeys.SENDER ("number") mapped to a String
EventDataKeys.INBOUND_MESSAGE ("message") mapped to a String
EventDataKeys.TIMESTAMP ("date") mapped to DateTime
{% endhighlight %}
This event is emitted for an inbound sms. The payload contains the sender's number, the message text and the timestamp when the sender sent the message.

	<h4>Persistence</h4>
The module persists SMS messages in database. Outbound messages and inbound messages are stored in separate databases which can be accesses through the respective repository classes AllOutboundSMS and AllInboundSMS. For outbound messages, the delivery status of the message will be updated when the status is received from the SMSC. The repository classes also expose a number of query methods to find messages based on a few some criteria.

	<h4>Configuration</h4>
Various SMPP parameters like can be configured through smpp.properties. The supported parameters are system_id, password, bind_type, bind_ton, bind_npi, source_ton, source_npi, dest_ton, dest_npi.

	<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>Several free SMSC simulators are available which can be used to test the module. We have included one of them (from Seleinum software) under motech/tools with a suitable configuration for testing out the module. We also recommend the one available from Logica.</p>
