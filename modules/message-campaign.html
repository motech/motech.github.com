    <h3>Message Campaign Module</h3>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>The MOTECH message campaign module is used to enroll users into messaging campaigns. A user may be a patient, worker, lab, facility, or other desired recipient of the information to be disseminated. A campaign is a course of informational messages that are sent to the target user on an assigned date or schedule. A user can be entered into a campaign at any point during its duration via a Campaign Request. Users may be removed or re-enrolled into campaigns. The languages and formats of the campaign messages can be specified (IVR, SMS, English, etc). Campaign messages follow a clearly defined schedule and are automatically triggered by the scheduling system.</p>


    <h4>Information for implementation</h4>
    <p>Campaigns are for the dissemination of information defined by their campaign messages. There are four key concerns for end users:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Defining the campaign's characteristics</li>
      <li>Starting or stopping a specific campaign message for a user, or stopping an entire campaign (all messages) for a user</li>
      <li>Providing the content for campaign messages</li>
      <li>Querying enrollments by a variable set of criterion (campaign name, external Id, status)</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Configuration</h4>
    <p>The module provides its configuration in a messageCampaign.properties file. This file specifies the name and location of the JSON message campaign.</p>
  
   <h4>Defining the campaign's characteristics</h4>
    <p>Specifying the characteristics of a campaign and its messages is typically accomplished using a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) document. The messageCampaign.properties configuration file specifies the location and name of the JSON message campaign file. Campaigns have a name and type in addition to other fields depending on the message type.</p>

    <h4>Types</h4>
    <p>Each Campaign has a type, which is determined by an enumeration called CampaignType. The CampaignType determines the type of message that 
will apply to the campaign. In a particular campaign, all campaign messages must be of the same campaign type. 
The module contains five different campaign types: absolute, offset, repeat interval, day of week, and cron. All campaigns contain a field for the 
campaign name and a list of campaign messages. Each type of campaign has additional fields that correspond to its type specification. Each campaign message 
has the fields name, formats, languages, messageKey, and startTime, along with additional fields depending on its CampaignType.</p>
    <h5>Absolute Campaign</h5>
    <p>This type of campaign is specified as ABSOLUTE. Absolute campaign messages contain the additional field: date, which indicates the date 
that they will be sent on at the time specified by the startTime. </p>

    {% highlight javascript %}
    {
      "name" : "Absolute Dates Message Program",

    <h5>Offset Campaign</h5>
    <p>This type of campaign is specified as OFFSET. Offset campaigns include an additional field: maxDuration. This field specifies the 
maximum duration of the campaign. Offset campaign messages contain the additional field timeOffset. The value of this field is determined 
by a message campaign scheduler. This scheduler specifies how much time elapses from a specified reference date before the job (message) will be 
scheduled. If no reference date is supplied, then the message campaign scheduler uses the current date as the reference date. OFFSET campaigns allow 
clients to enroll into the sequence of messages at any point within the sequence.</p>

    <h5>Repeat Interval Campaign</h5>
    <p>This type of campaign is specified as REPEAT_INTERVAL. Repeat interval campaigns also include the additional 
maxDuration field, which specifies the maximum duration in which the messages will be repeated. Repeating
campaign messages contain the following additional message field: repeatInterval. The repeat interval combined with the 
maximum duration determines how many messages will be scheduled at the time specified by the startTime.

<h4>Enrolling a user into a campaign</h4> 
    <p>A campaign request associates a user (worker, patient, lab, etc.) with a unique campaign name, start time, and reference date. 
The campaign name determines which campaign will be retrieved or unscheduled from the JSON document. The reference date determines 
the calendar date that the campaign will begin for that user. If no reference date is supplied, then the current date upon enrollment is used 
in its place. The start time specifies what time of day in hours and minutes that the message will be sent. </p>

   <img src="/assets/modules/campaignrequest.PNG"/>
<p>  The message-campaign module exposes a MessageCampaignService interface with two methods that accept a Campaign Request 
object: startFor and stopAll. The startFor method creates an enrollment record for the request. It also schedules a campaign's 
message or messages as jobs in the scheduler. The stopAll method unschedules all campaign messages 
from the campaign. The search() method allows querying for enrollments and is discussed below. The getCampaignTimings() method returns the time
schedule of messages for a given active campaign.</p>
    

    <img src="/assets/modules/messagecampaignservice.png"/>

    <h4>Content</h4>
    <p>The content for messages is provided through the CMSlite module. </p>

    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p>Below is an example of a JSON document that includes two campaigns, each with a number of campaign messages. 
Each campaign object has three fields: name, type and an array of messages. Each message contains fields determined 
by its type. Campaign requests associate the user with these campaigns. A reference to the campaign's name, such 
as "Absolute Dates Message Program" must be included in the CampaignRequest. This allows the system to schedule jobs 
for the user based on the associated campaign. In the below example, if a user is enrolled in "Absolute Dates Message Program", 
two separate jobs (messages) will be scheduled. In the "Relative Parameterized Dates Message Program", twelve jobs will be 
scheduled for the user. The number of repeating messages is determined by the repeat intervals compared with the maximum duration. 
In the example below, Repeating Message #1 would have five scheduled messages due to a maximum duration of five weeks and repeat intervals of 1 week.
Repeating Message #2 would have four scheduled messages due to a maximum duration of five weeks and repeat intervals of nine days. </p>

    <h3>Events consumed and emitted by the message campaign module</h3>

    <h4>Consumed events:</h4>
    <p>The EndOfCampaignNotifier handles and consumes events with the key EventKeys.SEND_MESSAGE.</p>

    {% highlight java %}
    EventKeys.SEND_MESSAGE (org.motechproject.server.messagecampaign.fired-campaign-message)
    Parameters/Payload (originating from a CampaignRequest):
      EventKeys.CAMPAIGN_NAME_KEY (CampaignName)
      EventKeys.EXTERNAL_ID_KEY (ExternalID)
    {% endhighlight %}

    <br>
    

    <h4>Emitted events:</h4>
<p> Each type of campaign has its own scheduler service that extends the class CampaignSchedulerService.
Each of these scheduler services raises events with the key EventKeys.SEND_MESSAGE each time a new message job of the appropriate type is scheduled.</p>

    {% highlight java %}
    EventKeys.SEND_MESSAGE (org.motechproject.server.messagecampaign.fired-campaign-message)
    Parameters/Payload
      EventKeys.CAMPAIGN_NAME_KEY (CampaignName) - used to find the campaign message, from the CampaignEnrollment object.
      EventKeys.MESSAGE_KEY (MessageKey) - used from the CampaignMessage to find the message.
      EventKeys.SCHEDULE_JOB_ID_KEY (JobID) - from the the CampaignEnrollment object.
      EventKeys.EXTERNAL_ID_KEY (ExternalID) - user ID, from the the CampaignEnrollment object.
    {% endhighlight %}


<p>Upon completion of a campaign, the EndOfCampaignNotifier raises events with the key EventKeys.CAMPAIGN_COMPLETED.</p>
   {% highlight java %}
    EventKeys.CAMPAIGN_COMPLETED(org.motechproject.server.messagecampaign.campaign-completed)
    Parameters/Payload (originating from a CampaignEnrollment):
	EventKeys.EXTERNAL_ID_KEY,
        EventKeys.CAMPAIGN_NAME_KEY
  {% endhighlight %}


    <h4>Additional information:</h4>

    <p>The message key uniquely identifies campaign messages (even repeat interval messages have their own unique message key). 
The external ID field of the Campaign Request is a user ID, identifying a patient, nurse, lab, facility, etc.

<p>The unique Job ID is a string constructed from EventKeys.BASE_SUBJECT, two fields from the campaign request: 
campaign name and external ID, and one field from the campaign message: messageKey.</p>

<p>As an example, if the campaign name is Campaign1, externalID is 123 and the message key is MessageKey4, then the 
Job ID would be: org.motechproject.server.messagecampaign.Campaign1.123.MessageKey4.</p>

<p>Note that some characteristics of a campaign message (for example, repeatInterval from repeat interval messages) 
are not sent as part of an event payload.</p>

    <h4>Querying enrollments</h4> 
    <p>The module's Message Campaign Service, in addition to its capability to start or stop all message(s), is capable of searching Campaign Enrollment 
Records based on particular criteria provided by a Campaign Enrollments Query object. This  service's search() allows the client to query for enrollment records
 using various criteria: external ID, status, and/or campaign name. Queries are built by adding one or more of these criteria to the Campaign Enrollment 
Query's list of criteria. The clauses together define specific search criteria. The method returns a list of matching Campaign Enrollment Records.</p>

	<p>Examples:

	{% highlight java %}
	messageCampaignService.search(new CampaignEnrollmentsQuery().havingState(CampaignEnrollmentStatus.ACTIVE))
	{% endhighlight %}

	will find all active enrollments</p>

	{% highlight java %}
	messageCampaignService.search(
		new CampaignEnrollmentsQuery()
			.withCampaignName("My Program")
			.havingState(CampaignEnrollmentStatus.ACTIVE)
	{% endhighlight %}

	will find active enrollments enrolled into "My Program" campaign.
	</p>

    <h4>Questions for the message campaign module</h4>

    <p>It seems that the search() method of the Message Campaign Service could vary in performance based on the order of the criteria specified.
 Because each order of filtering will ultimately result in the same set, it seems there should be a recommended order in order to maximize 
performance. Would it be advisable that one initially specifies a query that would return the minimized subset of results (for example, 
query based on campaign name), and select further queries from this subset? Or should the query collect a larger subset first (for example, 
query based on enrollment status), and then become more narrow?</p>

<p>In addition, would an implementer ever have a reason to use the Campaign Enrollment Service directly to query for enrollments?</p>
