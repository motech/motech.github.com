    <h3> Module</h3> 

    <h4>Description</h4> 
    <p>
      The MoTeCH OpenMRS API module is a concrete implementation of the MoTeCH MRS API module for the OpenMRS project (http://www.openmrs.org). Implementers should include this module if they 
      intend to use the OpenMRS as their primary medical record system. This module uses the OpenMRS client API (openmrs-api.jar, an artifact provided by the OpenMRS project) to communicate with an OpenMRS installation  
    </p>
    <h4>Information for implementation</h4> 
    <p>
      OpenMRS requires a client be authenticated and a session to be open before they can interact with their API. The MoTeCH OpenMRS API module  provides two convenient Java annotations to make <br />
      this a seamless process. Implementers can annotate the Java methods that interact with the MoTeCH MRS API, and MoTeCH will handle this automatically through aspect oriented programming (AOP).<br />
      <br />
      The two annotations are: <br />
      LoginAsAdmin - Sets the current user to the admin using the credentials defined in the openmrs.properties file.<br />
      ApiSession - Opens, starts and closes an OpenMRS session. <br />
      <br />
      Example usage:<br />
      @LoginAsAdmin<br />
      @ApiSession<br />
      public boolean hasConcept(String patientId, String conceptName) {<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;List<MRSObservation> observationList = <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observationAdapter.findObservation(patientId, conceptName);<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
      }    
    </p>
    
    <h4>Configuration</h4>
    <p>
      Implementers should be aware of the following configuration requirements when working with the MoTeCH OpenMRS API module:<br />
      <br />
      openmrs.properties file<br />
      Implementers will need to include an openmrs.properties file in their classpath. The openmrs.properties file contains the database credentials and admin user information for the OpenMRS installation.<br />
      <br />
      Example openmrs.properties (taken from motech-openmrs-api/src/test/resources):<br />
      openmrs.host=localhost<br />
      openmrs.database=openmrs_api_test<br />
      openmrs.db.username=openmrs<br />
      openmrs.db.password=password<br />
      openmrs.admin.username=admin<br />
      openmrs.admin.password=P@ssw0rd
    </p>
    
    <h3>Events consumed and emitted by the OpenMRS module</h3>

    <h4>Consumed events:</h4>
    <p>
      No events consumed by OpenMRS API module
    </p>
    <h4>Emitted events:</h4>
    <p>
      No events emitted by OpenMRS API module
    </p>
    
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>
      Should MoTeCH OpenMRS API module  use the REST web services for OpenMRS?  MoTeCH currently uses the openmrs-api.jar, which communicates directly with the OpenMRS database. 
      Using the web services would eliminate some of the configuration required to use the openmrs-api.jar. In addition, it may make it easier to communicate between an OpenMRS and MoTeCH installation 
      that reside on separate hosts.
