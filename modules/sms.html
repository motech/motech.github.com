    <h3>SMS API Module</h3> 

    <h4>Description</h4> 
<p>The SMS API module provides implementers with an event-driven SMS framework. The SMS module 
alone is not enough to send SMS messages; an accompanying listener must also be included or implemented.</p>

    <h4>Information for implementation</h4> 
<p>The SMS-api provides a single service interface for raising <em>SendSMS</em> events in the system. 
The key concern is to have an appropriate event handler for the <em>SendSMS</em> event. The SMS API will split 
a single message into multiple messages based on a maximum character count of 160. Each split message will 
have its own send SMS event raised in the system.</p>

    <h4>Configuration</h4>
<p>
	<span>The following properties can be changed in the <strong>sms-api.properties</strong> file: </span>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>sms.multi.recipient.supported:</strong> Set this to false when the SMS provider 
		does not support multiple recipients in single call. The default is true.</li>
		<li><strong>sms.schedule.future.sms:</strong> Set this to false when the SMS provider supports
		 scheduling of SMS on their end. The default is true.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

    <h4>Events consumed and emitted by the SMS module</h4>

<p>There are no events consumed in this module.</p>

<h5>Emitted events:</h5><br />
{% highlight java %}
Subject: EventSubjects.SEND_SMS ("SendSMS")
Payload:
EventDataKeys.RECIPIENTS ("number"): List<String> containing the recipients of the message
EventDataKeys.MESSAGE ("message"): String containing the message text
EventDataKeys.DELIVERY_TIME ("delivery_time") DateTime containing the time the message should be delivered
{% endhighlight %}


    <h4>SMS Interface</h4>
<p>The SMS interface provides four methods:
	<li>A method for sending a single message to a single recipient.</li>
	<li>A method for sending a single message to a list of recipients.</li>
	<li>A method for sending a single message to a single recipient at a specified delivery time.</li>
	<li>A method for sending a single message to a list of recipients at a specified delivery time.</li>
 
<img src="/assets/modules/smsinterface.png"/>

<p>An implementer should access this interface by injecting the SmsService bean into the calling class.</p>

<p>Two modules consume the SEND_SMS event: SMS HTTP and SMS SMPP. An implementer may also consume
 this event and send the SMS message through a different format.</p>

<h4>Questions</h4>
<p>Currently, there is no implementation of SMS auditing. Are there plans to implement this?</p>
