    <h3>SMS-API Module</h3> 

    <h4>Description</h4> 
<p>The SMS-api module provides implementers with an event driven SMS framework. The SMS module alone is not enough to send SMS messages; an accompanying listener must also be included or implemented.</p>
    <h4>Information for implementation</h4> 
<p>The SMS-api provides a single service interface for raising "send SMS" events in the system. The key concern is to have an appropriate event handler for the send SMS event. The SMS-api will split a single message into multiple messages based on a maximum character count of 160. Each split message will have its own send SMS event raised in the system.</p>
    <h4>Configuration</h4>

    <h3>Events consumed and emitted by the SMS module</h3>

<h4>Emitted events:</h4><br />
<em>Subject</em>: EventSubjects.SEND_SMS (&quot;SendSMS&quot;)<br />
<em>Payload:</em><br />
EventDataKeys.RECIPIENTS (&quot;number&quot;) mapped to a List&lt;String&gt;<br />
EventDataKeys.MESSAGE (&quot;message&quot;) mapped to a String<br />
EventDataKeys.DELIVERY_TIME (&quot;delivery_time&quot;) mapped to a DateTime<br />
<br />


    <h3>Sms Interface</h3>
<p>The SMS interface provides four methods, one for sending a single message to a single recipient, one for sending a single message to a list of recipients, one for sending a single message to a single recipient at a specified delivery time, and one for sending a single message to a list of recipients at a specified delivery time. An implementer should access this interface by using Spring dependency injection.</p>

<p>Two modules consume the SEND_SMS event: SMS-HTTP and SMS-SMPP. An implementer may also consume this event and send the SMS message through a different format.</p>
