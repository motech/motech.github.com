    <h3> Module</h3> 

    <h4>Description</h4> 
    <p>
      The MRS API module provides a generic, lightweight API for interacting with medical record systems. Out-of-the-box, the module has several service interfaces that 
      clients can use to interact with medical record systems. In addition, the module contains a well defined data model for storing and accessing patient information.    
    </p>

    <h4>Information for implementation</h4> 
    <p>
      Implementers should use the MRS API in conjunction with a concrete MRS implementation. The MoTeCH platform provides an OpenMRS implementation (see OpenMRS API module) that can be used by implementers.
      <br /><br />
      The terminology within the MRS API data model is similar to the OpenMRS project. Implementers should be familiar with the following classes:<br />
      MRSPerson - An individual in the MRS, e.g. a patient, provider of care, or user of the system. A person includes first name, last name, address, date of birth, and gender.<br />
      MRSPatient - A person who is registered as a patient in the MRS<br />
      MRSEncounter - When a patient visits a hospital or health clinic, or more generally, any interaction between a patient and health care worker. An encounter includes a date, a patient and number of observations.<br />
      MRSObservation - Something measured or observed during an encounter. Examples include: weight, temperature, and pulse.<br />
      MRSFacility - A physical place where an encounter can occur, e.g. hospital or health clinic.<br />
    </p>
    
    <h4>Service Interfaces</h4>
    <p>
      Implementers should use the service interfaces (the org.motechproject.mrs.services package) for interacting with the MRS. The service interfaces contain methods for creating and retrieving 
      the various data model classes. For example, MRSEncounterAdapter is a service class for creating and retrieving MRSEncounter objects.
