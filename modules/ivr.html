    <h3>IVR Platform Module</h3> 

    <h4>Description</h4> 
<p>The IVR module acts as a basic framework for implementing IVR functionality in the platform. The module provides one implementation of an IVR service that connects to an Asterick server using VoiceGlue VXML browser.
</p>
    <h4>Information for implementation</h4> 
<p>The IVR module provides a common interface that IVR modules should implement, IVRService.
IVRService has one method, initiateCall, which accepts a CallRequest object. CallRequests represent the information regarding a call and events associated with the results of that call.</p>

<h4>Example Implementation</h4>
<p>The interface for connecting MOTECH with OnMobile, the aggregator used for the <a href="/about/implementations.html">Ananya</a> project in Bihar, is documented in the <a href=/assets/specs/ananya_ivr_services_v1.pdf">Ananya IVR services document</a>.
</p>

<h4>A CallRequest has:</h4>
<ul>
<li>phone (String) - The phone number to call</li>
<li>timeOut (int) - The time out value for the call</li>
<li>callBackUrl (String) - The URL for VXML content</li>
<li>payload (Map<String,String>) - A map for adding additional data to the call, this is where your unique identifier would be placed.</li>
<li>onSuccessEvent (MotechEvent) - The event fired when the call is successful.</li>
<li>onBusyEvent (MotechEvent) - The event fired when the call is busy.</li>
<li>onNoAnswerEvent (MotechEvent) - The event fired when the call is not answered.</li>
<li>onFailureEvent (MotechEvent) - The event fired when the call failed for some reason.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Asterisk implementations:</h4>

<p>IVRServiceAsteriskImpl is the bean to wire IVRService with if you want to use the Asterisk server.
</p>
<p>MotechAsteriskCallBackImpl provides CallDetailRecord keeping and events for the various stages and results of calls.
