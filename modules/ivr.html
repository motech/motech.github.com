    <h3>IVR Platform Module</h3> 

    <h4>Description</h4> 
<p>The IVR module acts as a basic framework for implementing IVR functionality in the platform. The module provides one implementation of an IVR service that connects to an Asterick server using VoiceGlue VXML browser.
</p>
    <h4>Information for implementation</h4> 
<p>The IVR module provides a common interface that IVR modules should implement, IVRService.
IVRService has one method, initiateCall, which accepts a CallRequest object. CallRequests represent the information regarding a call and events associated with the results of that call.</p>
