    <h3> Module</h3> 

    <h4>Description</h4> 
<p>The SMS-HTTP module is an SMS implementation that handles send SMS events that were raised by the SMS-API module. Its purpose is to provide a general SMS messaging framework using templates in order to send SMS messages through HTTP to a specified SMS provider that is responsible for dispatching the message.</p>

    <h4>Information for implementation</h4> 
<p>The SMS-HTTP module should be deployed alongside the SMS-API module. An implementation should use the SMS service provided by the SMS-API module in order to send their messages. These message events are handled by the HTTP module. The HTTP module uses the Apache Commons HTTP Client to generate the HTTP requests. The implementer never directly calls this module. Templates must be specified for custom query parameters and the URI of the SMS provider. See configuration below.</p>
    <h4>Configuration</h4>
<p>An implementer must configure a sms-http-template.json file like the one found in the test resources folder. This file is responsible for providing the template information the module needs in order to generate the HTTP requests. An example template is provided below:</p>
    <img src="/assets/modules/exampletemplate1.PNG"/>
<p>$recipients and $message act as placeholders that are dynamically filled in when the message is generated.</p>
<p>queryParameters are appended to the request urlPath</p>
<p>The request field in the templates is used to generate the HTTP request. The response field is used to check the HTTP response. If the actual response does not contain the text found in the response field from the json template, an SmsDeliveryFailureException is thrown. Otherwise the message is considered sent.
</p>

<p>The above template is similar to the kookoo template. However, the URL differs, there are additional query parameters, and each recipient phone number is separated by "+" in the request string.</p>
<h3>Events consumed and emitted by the SMS-HTTP module</h3>

    <h4>Consumed events:</h4></br>
Subject: EventSubjects.SEND_SMS ("SendSMS")</br>
Payload:</br>
EventDataKeys.RECIPIENTS ("number") mapped to a List<String></br>
EventDataKeys.MESSAGE ("message") mapped to a String </br>
EventDataKeys.DELIVERY_TIME ("delivery_time") mapped to a DateTime</br>

    <h4>Emitted events:</h4>
<p>The SMS-HTTP module does not currently emit any events</p>

    <h3>Questions</h3>
<p>Currently the SMS-HTTP module does not support authentication. See the campaign demonstration branch for a work around for simple authentication.
</p>
<p>
An implementation uses the SMS-API service to interact with the HTTP module. This means they cannot catch SmsDeliveryFailureExceptions that the HTTP module throws, because it is not in their calling thread of execution.
