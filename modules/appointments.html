    <h3>Appointments Module</h3> 

    <h4>Description</h4> 

    <p>The Appointments Module stores the schedule of reminders that are associated with an appointment (or other scheduled patient activity).  It raises events for those reminders at the appropriate time.  This module is used to trigger actions that may need to happen relative to a particular fixed date appointment. The module exposes an API which allows implementers to create, retrieve, edit, and delete events. Events can be stored with additional arbitrary data, including patient ID, appointment ID, voice tree, etc.</p>

    <h4>Information for implementation</h4> 

    <p>The Appointments module provides implementers with the following functionality:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create a calander of appointments and associate it with an entity</li>
      <li>Remove a calander of appointments</li>
      <li>Add visits to an existing calendar</li>
      <li>Remove visits from an existing calendar</li>
      <li>Confirm an appointment</li>
      <li>Reschedule an appointment</li>
      <li>Mark an appointment as attended</li>
      <li>Mark and appointment as missed</li>
      <li>Track visits and remind users to schedule a firm date for an appointment</li>
      <li>Track firm appointments and remind users about them</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Common Actions</h3>
    <p>In all of the example code snippets below it is the implementers responsibility to provide an id for the user and to make sure all service classes are properly configured via spring.  In the future the mechanism for accessing the service classes will instead be through an OSGi service registry.</p>

    <h4>Create a Visit</h4>
    {% highlight java %}
    CreateVisitRequest baseline = new CreateVisitRequest().setVisitName("baseline")
                                                          .setAppointmentDueDate(now.plusWeeks(1));
    {% endhighlight %}

    <h4>Create a Visit with a Reminder Schedule</h4>

                                                                             .setIntervalUnit(ReminderConfiguration.IntervalUnit.HOURS)

                                                                                 .addVisitRequest(baseline)

    <h3>Configuration</h3>

    <p>This module does not require any configuration</p>

    <h3>Events consumed and emitted by the Appointments module</h3>

    <h4>Consumed events:</h4>

    <p>This module does not consume any events.</p>

    <h4>Emitted events:</h4>

    <p>When an entity should be reminded for a visit, the following event is emitted:</p>

    {% highlight java %}
    EventKeys.VISIT_REMINDER_EVENT_SUBJECT (org.motechproject.appointments.api.Visit.Reminder)
    This event is emitted by the scheduler. 
    Parameters/Payload:
      EXTERNAL_ID_KEY (external.id) - String
      VISIT_NAME (VisitName) - String
      JOB_ID_KEY (jobId) - String
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>When an entity should be reminded for an appointment, the following event is emitted:</p>

    {% highlight java %}
    EventKeys.APPOINTMENT_REMINDER_EVENT_SUBJECT (org.motechproject.appointments.api.Appointment.Reminder)
    This event is emitted by the scheduler. 
    Parameters/Payload:
      EXTERNAL_ID_KEY (external.id) - String
      VISIT_NAME (VisitName) - String
      JOB_ID_KEY (jobId) - String
    {% endhighlight %}

    <h3>Questions</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>I think the terminology is reversed.  I should create an Appointment, a Visit is when I actually attend</li>
      <li>Why are there so many *Request classes?  I should be able to understand how to use the module by only looking at the Service class</li>
      <li>Why is there an API on the Visit to create an Appointment?</li>
      <li>Why do I mark a Visit as missed?  You don't miss a visit, you miss an Appointment</li>
      <li>Why is the call to confirm an Appoinment on the Visit class?</li>
      <li>What is the Remind From field in reminder config?  API name isn't clear</li>
    </ul>
