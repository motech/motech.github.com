    <h3>Appointments Module</h3> 

    <h4>Description</h4> 

    <p>The Appointments Module stores the schedule of reminders that are associated with an appointment (or other scheduled patient activity).  It raises events for those reminders at the appropriate time.  This module is used to trigger actions that may need to happen relative to a particular fixed date appointment. The module exposes an API which allows implementers to create, retrieve, edit, and delete events. Events can be stored with additional arbitrary data, including patient ID, appointment ID, voice tree, etc.</p>
