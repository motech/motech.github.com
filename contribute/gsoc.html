    <h3>Google Summer of Code 2014</h3>

    <p>Welcome students! Below you'll find some information about how to apply for GSoC with MOTECH. We look forward to getting to know you.</p>
    
    <h4>Some Background on MOTECH</h4>
    <p>MOTECH is a platform for building mobile health applications that aim to improve health outcomes by providing better access to information. It has been used to educate pregnant women in Ghana and India about how to have healthy pregnancies, to train health workers in India, and to improve treatment regimen adherence for HIV/AIDS patients in India and Ethiopia. We have some big plans for how to expand the platform - and make it easier for non-technical users to get started with it - but our team is small and we'd love to get more contributors involved to help make those ideas into reality. You could be an important part of that!</p>
    
    <p>MOTECH is written in Java and makes use of a number of open source libraries and tools. Some of the major components it makes use of are ActiveMQ, Postgres, and the Quartz Scheduler. The system is composed of a base platform that encompasses a simple API, and pluggable modules. We use OSGi for module management/lifecycle. Our front-end is built with AngularJS. A successful candidate for contribution to MOTECH will have good fluency in Java/Spring and at least some familiarity with OSGi, Postgres, Quartz, ActiveMQ, and/or Angular.</p>
    
    <h4>Ideas List</h4>
    <p>This ideas list is just a start - most of these are rather open-ended and will require refinement. Feel free to contact the developers to get more information about a particular idea as you are forming your proposal around it. We welcome your original ideas as well (see the following section for the student submission template). You may also view this idea list as a query in our issue tracker <a href="https://applab.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=16660">here</a>.</p>
