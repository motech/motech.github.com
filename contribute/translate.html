    <h3>Translate MOTECH</h3>

    <p>Bonjour!</p>
    
    <p>We are using <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/MOTECH/">Transifex</a> to manage MOTECH translations, which makes it 
    easy for non-geeks to help. If you speak multiple languages and would like to help us make MOTECH multilingual, please start by checking
    out our translation page to determine whether your language(s) are on our list. Do we have a translation in progress for your language? Great! We'd love your help translating additional strings. Do we not have a translation started for your language? Also great! We'd love your help getting one started. </p>

    <p>Either way, please <a href="https://www.transifex.com/signup/contributor/">sign up for Transifex</a> (free), and then <a href="mailto:motech-dev@googlegroups.com">contact us</a>. Let us know your Transifex user ID and which language(s) you'd like to work on, and we'll help you get started.</p>
