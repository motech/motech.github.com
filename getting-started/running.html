    <h3>Running</h3>

    <p>For motech to successfully operate it needs several external processes up and running.  The first set of systems that need to be run are the set of dependent systems, ActiveMQ, Tomcat7, MySQL and CouchDB.  Motech also requires it's scheduler to be up and running.  If you have checked out and compiled motech according to the instructions on the <a href-"/getting-started/installation.html">installation</a> page then the following instructions should get the scheduler process up and running.  We'll be using default settings here, you should change these values for a production deployment.<p>

    <h5>Create the quartz database and user</h5>

{% highlight bash %}
% mysql -u root
mysql> create database quartz;
mysql> create user 'quartz'@'localhost' identified by 'quartz';
mysql> grant all privileges on quartz.* to 'quartz'@'localhost';
mysql> exit; 
{% endhighlight %}

	<h5>Initialize the Quartz schema</h5>

	<p>Included with the source to motech is a sql file that initializes quartz's schema.  To set up the schema cd into the directory where you checked out motech and run this command:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
% cd <motech src dir>
% mysql -u quartz -p quartz < motech-platform-scheduler/sql/create_db_schema_quartz_v1.8.sql
{% endhighlight %}

    <h5>'Install' the scheduler and a simple script to run it</h5>

{% highlight bash %}
% sudo mkdir /opt/motech-scheduler
% sudo cp motech-platform-scheduler/target/motech-platform-scheduler-*.one-jar.jar /opt/motech-scheduler/motech-platform-scheduler.jar
% cd /opt/motech-scheduler
% java -jar motech-platform-scheduler.jar
{% endhighlight %}
