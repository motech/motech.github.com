    <h3>Developing</h3>

    <p>To help provide you with an overview of development on MOTECH we've written a couple of guides</p>

    <h4><a href="/getting-started/couchdb.html">CouchDB</a></h4>

    <p>This is a short document that describes the class hierarchy required for persisting your data to CouchDB</p>

    <h4><a href="/getting-started/ping-pong.html">Ping Pong Demo</a></h4>

    <p>The Ping Pong Demo is a non-functional walkthrough of a simple app that is designed to give you a feel for developing on MOTECH with a special focus on the event based nature of the platform.</p>

    <h4><a href="/getting-started/schedule-tracking-demo.html">Schedule Tracking Demo</a></h4>

    <p>This is a fully functional demo application the shows how you can track users through a schedule and integrate with IVR.</p>
